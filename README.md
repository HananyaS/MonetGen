# MonetGen
The final project of the Deep Learning course at Bar Ilan University. 
In this project, we built two Monet-style image generators, given 30 Monet paintings and a pool of 7028 photos.
The generators had different architectures: the first one implemented a Cycle-GAN model to solve the task and the other second one is a Neural Style Transfer model.

The **train.ipynb** and **test.ipynb** notebooks have run on Google Colab servers, in the following links:
